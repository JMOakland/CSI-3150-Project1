                <li><h4>Bachelor'S in Computer Science, Oakland University:</h4>
                    <p id="articleList">
                    I am currently in the last semester of my Computer Science Degree at Oakland University with only two classes, so I am available to work part time. I currently have a 3.77 GPA and in the Fall 2022 semester I achieved a 4.0 GPA, putting me on the President’s List. I was also on the President’s List in the fall of 2021 and on the Dean’s List in the Fall 2020 semester. The team I led in my Senior Capstone Project class in the Fall 2022 semester earned first place for our project, an interactive algorithm visualizer application that was made to help CS students learn and understand algorithms. Thanks to my performance at Oakland Community College, I was awarded with the Phi Theta Kappa Award Merit Scholarship at Oakland University.   My course work has consisted of learning the basics of C, Java, and Ruby. I have also learned about the design and analysis of algorithms, networking, cybersecurity, and the basics of CPU functionality and design. I have had practice with HTML and JavaScript, and have become proficient in Java, Python, C, Ruby,  as well as Database management and creation. I have achieved an understanding of calculus, discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and statistics. Also, I have a beginner’s understanding of physics.

                    My GPA at Oakland Community College was 3.554, my academic achievements put me on the Dean’s List. At Oakland Community College, I took a wide variety of classes to satisfy the Michigan Transfer Agreement, so that I could transfer to Oakland University.

            <h2>Activities</h2>
            <p id="articleP">I am a big fan of electronics, but more specifically computers. I play video games frequently and enjoy using computers to code, edit videos, use photoshop, and make websites. I’ve built my own computer and love working with hardware. I also enjoy outside activities like hiking and boating. I have volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, Key Club and in a soup kitchen based out of Oxford United Methodist Church. I appreciate a chance to help others when the need arises. </p>
